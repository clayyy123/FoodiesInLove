# Foodies In Love
### Overview

Foodies In Love is a dating app where foodies can find other foodies who have the same taste in restaurants. It also brings back the old-fashion dating ways by assigning a restaurant for the matched users to eat at.

### Approach
  The approach for this project was a lot easier than I thought because I was able to piggyback off of other dating apps.  Wireframing and trello board was a definite must for organization.  
  After the wireframing, I laid everything out by making all the views and routes and followed it up with the back end side of the app. I focused on getting the MVP of the app down, before moving on to the features and design.

### User Stories
	1. As a user, I want to be able to chat with my matches.
	2. As a user, I want to be able to try out new restaurants.
	Audience: The audience my app targets are people who love food also known as foodies and want to try out new restaurants.

### Important Notes
#### Challenges:
Challenges still include CSS and getting used React.  I sometimes fallback to modifying the DOM rather than setting the state to re-render what is showing.  In this project, I tend to find myself running into problems and patching it by working my way around it rather than actually fixing the problem.
